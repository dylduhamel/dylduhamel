I am a Wake Forest University Computer Science graduate and a dedicated Software Engineer! I love to create high-quality solutions and employ my expertise in C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Next.js, and more!

I am deeply interested in Linux systems as well. I especially enjoy working with embedded Linux machines. I am currently advancing my knowledge in computer/network security and enjoying participating in CTF events!
