I am a Wake Forest University Computer Science graduate and a dedicated Software Engineer! I love to create high-quality solutions and employ my expertise in C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Next.js, and more!

I have a keen interest in Linux systems as well. I enjoy delving into the intricacies of Linux/UNIX, especially working with embedded Linux machines. I am currently learning about cellular automaton and displaying the generations on LED matricies with ESP32 boards.
